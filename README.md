# Light Scattering Monte Carlo Simulation in Visual Studio VC++
Conversion of Jakes code to VS project
/********************************************

* Original work from Biomedical Optics Series

Steven L. Jacques, Scott A. Prahl 

 *  mc321.c    , in ANSI Standard C programing language

 *

 *  Monte Carlo simulation yielding spherical, cylindrical, and planar

 *    responses to an isotropic point source in an infinite homogeneous

 *    medium with no boundaries. This program is a minimal Monte Carlo

 *    program scoring photon distributions in spherical, cylindrical,

 *    and planar shells.

 *

 *  A published report illustrates use of the program:

 *    S. L. Jacques: "Light distributions from point, line, and plane

 *    sources for photochemical reactions and fluorescence in turbid

 *    biological tissues," Photochem. Photobiol. 67:23-32, 1998.

 *  Trivial fixes to remove warnings SAP, 11/2017

 *  Modified by Jose E. Calderon University of Puerto Rico for a solution in VS C++ 2017.
